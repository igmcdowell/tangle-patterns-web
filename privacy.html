          <p>The short story is the Tangle Library iOS app does not collect any data on users.  If this changes, I'll be sure to update this page and put a notification in the app. Here's the rundown:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collected Data:</strong> No data is collected by the Tangle Library iOS app.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> As no data is collected, no data is shared.</li>
            <li><strong>Deleting Your Data:</strong> As no data is collected, there is no data to delete.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>While I'm not collecting anything right now, there are few compelling reasons to track user behavior in this app; there are tools I could add that would help me track what features are being used (so I can improve them), and monitor for crashes/bugs (so I can prevent them).  If I choose to add any of these tools to the app in the future, I will update this page and put an in-app notification.</p>
